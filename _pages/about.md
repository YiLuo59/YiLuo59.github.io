I am currently in the second year of my Master's degree from [School of Informatics](https://informatics.xmu.edu.cn/), [Xiamen University](https://www.xmu.edu.cn/). I am advised by Prof. [Chen Lin](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=z1l2JSMAAAAJ) of [Data Mining Group](https://xmudm.github.io/), XMU. I received a B.E. in Artificial Intelligence from the School of Informatics, Xiamen University in 2023.

**🎓📩I’m actively seeking Ph.D. position in 2026 Fall! I would be sincerely grateful for any opportunities or connections.**

## 🧐 Research Interests

Currently, my research interests are primarily focused on Large Language Models (LLMs), covering the following topics:

- **LLM-based Agents**: Investigating autonomous LLM-driven agents for scientific research (e.g., hypothesis generation and experimental design) and human-computer interaction, leveraging multimodal reasoning and tool-augmented architectures.

- **LLM Security:** Developing robust defense mechanisms against adversarial attacks, data poisoning, and jailbreaking threats while maintaining model utility.

- **LLMs' Reasoning Capabilities**: Enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) with a focus on: rule summarization, mathematical reasoning and long-context logical reasoning.

🤝 Looking for collaboration! If you are interested in working with me, please drop me an email.
